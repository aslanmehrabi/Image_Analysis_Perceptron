# Imgage-Analysis-Perceptron
Detection of eight Latin characters(A,B,C,D,E,J,K) by Image Analysis using Perceptron.
Each image is converted to binary pixels of size 9*7.

Sample Data: 4 samples for each character has been attached to the project. 

Running the project on the samle data: For the case of using 3 first samples of each character as train set and the last sample as the test set, the writtern code was able to detect all of the test characters correctly.

Phase 2: Detecting the threshold of number of pixel errors (By generating random noises) to keep the accuracy of classification greater than 95%
